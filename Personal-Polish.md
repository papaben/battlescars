Some thoughts on the little behaviors in the work place that combine to emanate a polished demeanor. 

# Always treat people like humans

 * If you lose your cool, attempt to do it in private
 * Never be short with anyone at any level

# Emails

* Be aware they exist
* Know when you should be responding: if and when

## Sending emails

* Use concise subjects
* Get to the point quickly
* Include links to relevant documents
* Use BCC sparingly. When you do, always list who is BCC'ed as much as appropriate
* Be light on op-ed unless the email context calls for that. You want to avoid the email chain devolving into a stream of opinions and losing focus on the original task at hand.
* Pay attention to the squigglies -- misspellings rarely shine a positive light upon you

# Meetings

* Be aware they exist!
* Be on time!
* Get good at using your calendar

## Scheduling Meetings

The description of the event should,
1. Include relevant links
1. Set an agenda

## After a meeting

Ensure that the following are sent to the attendees.
1. a summary
1. meeting notes
1. action items with assignees (or a plan for assigning)

## When presenting and sharing your screen

 * Disable all notifications
 * Close your non-relevant browser windows
 * Have a functioning microphone and speakers / headphones. Know how to use them. Do not have background noise. Mute when applicable. 
 * When applicable: open the meeting participants window in a different window than the window you share

# Task management

* Learn how to use a task management software successfully. Never blame your task management software for your failure to deliver. 
* Know when you need to respond and by when
* Be upfront if you can't do something in expected timeline
* Get good at prioritizing your time and tasks: frequently ask yourself if what you are choosing to work on is the most important thing for the company
