# On Temporary things

Almost nothing ends up being temporary. Many more times than not, the hacks or fixes to temporarily punt a problem down 
the road end up sticking around for much longer than intended. Is this a problem? Not necessarily. Problems will get 
fixed correctly when their time comes; but the important takeaway from this is that the method taken to implement a temporary 
fix and the supporting documentation around it (wiki, emails, communication, etc.) should be treated seriously. Their 
 absence will otherwise most surely come back to bite you!
